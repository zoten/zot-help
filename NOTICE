This is just a notes repo.
Scripts and software here may be work of mine, stackoverflow answers, tips, tricks, my cat's or dog's hints.

Some things come from plain old text files in my work's notebook, so I may have lost the references.

I'll try to maintain attribution, but if you find your work and you want it signed with a wonderful comment, just text me or send a pull request :)

Use everything here at your own risk, I can't guarantee things will work!
