# S3 tips&tricks

## Access Control List based on email

You can understand if a mail has an AWS account by the means of `PutBucketACL` operation

``` yaml
s3_client.put_bucket_acl(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    AccessControlPolicy={
        'Grants': [
            {
                'Grantee': {
                    'EmailAddress': 'some@emailtotest.com',
                    'Type': 'AmazonCustomerByEmail',
                },
                'Permission': 'READ'
            },
        ],
        'Owner': {
            'DisplayName': 'Whatever',
            'ID': 'c3d78ab5093a9ab8a5184de715d409c2ab5a0e2da66f08c2f6cc5c0bdeadbeef'
        }
    }
)
```

If email has not an AWS account you will get

``` bash
botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (UnresolvableGrantByEmailAddress) when calling the PutBucketAcl operation: The e-mail address you provided does not match any account on record.
```

## Uploader gets to choose storage class

If you share S3 buckets with ext people, they could hijack how much you pay

``` bash
aws s3 cp "my.txt" "s3://mybucket/myobject.txt" --storage-class [CLASS]
```

You can workaround with an IAM policy

``` yaml
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowStandardAndStandardIAOnly",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-storage-class": ["STANDARD"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

(Most S3 object-related things are controlled by the uploader, like tags, for example)
